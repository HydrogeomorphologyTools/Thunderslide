# Thunderslide
Thuderslide idea/framework: retrieving freely available weather radar data for a desired area; selecting very intense events and obtain a mask/ROI of those; creating a time-lapse video with leaflet background of the event; entering Sentinel EO API with the retrieved areas; computing change detection for evaluating preliminary mapping of landslides, debris flows, windthrows and changes in general. The tool is intended to be operational for local management authorities in order to have a raw preliminary map of detected changes related to a specific event or to a series of events. The approach could help also for un unbiased census encompassing high altitude events that might not be tracked in case they do not interact with anthropic-related features.
